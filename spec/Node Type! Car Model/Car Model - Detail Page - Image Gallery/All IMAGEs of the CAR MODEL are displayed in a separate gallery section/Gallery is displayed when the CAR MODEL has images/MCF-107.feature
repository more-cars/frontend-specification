@REQ_MCF-41
Feature: Car Model - Detail Page - Image Gallery
  As a visitor\
  On the CAR MODEL detail page\
  I want to see a gallery of all attached IMAGEs\
  So I can get a visual impression of the car from different angles

  @RULE_MCF-105
  Rule: All IMAGEs of the CAR MODEL are displayed in a separate gallery section

    @TEST_MCF-107
    Scenario: Gallery is displayed when the CAR MODEL has images
      Given there exists a CAR MODEL "Camaro"
      And there exists an IMAGE "front"
      And IMAGE "front" is connected to CAR MODEL "Camaro"
      When the user visits the detail page of the CAR MODEL "Camaro"
      Then there should be an image gallery
      And the image gallery should contain the IMAGE "front"
