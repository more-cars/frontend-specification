It contains all properties that are specified for the node type BRAND. -> See MCF-2\n* Each property in the fact sheet is displayed as a key-value pair, with the property name and the property value.\n* When a property has no value (null or undefined) it is still displayed in the fact sheet, but marked as empty.\n* The name of the BRAND is reflected in the main headline and in the page title. The page title might contain additional text, like the suffix 'More Cars'. The main headline might also contain additional information to make generic nodes more unique.\n",
