@REQ_MCF-40
Feature: BRAND detail page » connected IMAGES
  As a visitor\
  On the BRAND detail page\
  I want to see a gallery of all attached IMAGEs\
  So I can see how the BRAND logo evolved over the time

  @RULE_MCF-121
  Rule: Each IMAGE links to the respective detail page

    @TEST_MCF-122
    Scenario: Navigating to a linked IMAGE
      Given there exists a "BRAND" "Jaguar"
      And there exists an "IMAGE" "front-left"
      And IMAGE "front-left" is connected to BRAND "Jaguar"
      When the user visits the detail page of the "BRAND" "Jaguar"
      And the user follows the link to the IMAGE "front-left"
      Then the user should have been redirected to the detail page of the IMAGE "front-left"
