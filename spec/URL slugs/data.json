  "description": "* the goal is to create human-readable, seo-friendly and bookmark-friendly URLs\n* scope: for now only NODE detail pages\n* example:\n  * before: `/companies/10000424`\n  * after: `/ford-motor-company-10000424`\n* the slug does not explicitly include information about the node type\n  * it might be included in some case (e.g. `lap-time-1m-30.3s`), but that is **not** mandatory\n* each existing link to a detail page is to be replaced by the slug versions (e.g. on the overview pages)\n* the URL pattern is always: `/<slug>-<id>`\n* in general, the slug is created from the name of the node&#x20;\n  * but the code needs to be flexible enough to allow other properties to be the base (lap times for example have no name)\n* slug conversion rules:\n  * all characters to lower case\n  * whitespaces are replaced by a hyphen\n  * characters that are not allowed in an URL are removed or replaced (e.g. `ä` → `ae`)\n* redirects are handled in a different ticket → <https://dennis-gerike.atlassian.net/browse/MCF-217>&#x20;\n",
