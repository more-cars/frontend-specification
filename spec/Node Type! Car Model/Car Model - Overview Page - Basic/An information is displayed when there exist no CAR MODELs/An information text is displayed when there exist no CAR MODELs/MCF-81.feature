@REQ_MCF-36
Feature: Car Model - Overview Page - Basic
  As a visitor\
  I want to have a list of all CAR MODELs (incl. some basic information)\
  So I can scroll through them to find interesting ones (e.g. strange name, very old, built for a very long time)

  @RULE_MCF-67
  Rule: An information is displayed when there exist no CAR MODELs

    @TEST_MCF-81
    Scenario: An information text is displayed when there exist no CAR MODELs
      Given there exist 0 "CAR MODEL"s
      When the user visits the "CAR MODEL" overview page
      Then the CAR MODEL list should not be displayed
      And a message should be shown that there are no CAR MODELs to display
