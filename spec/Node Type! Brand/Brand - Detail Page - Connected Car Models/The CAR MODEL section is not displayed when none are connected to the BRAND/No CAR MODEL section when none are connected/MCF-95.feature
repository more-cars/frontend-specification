@REQ_MCF-39
Feature: Brand - Detail Page - Connected Car Models
  As a visitor\
  On the BRAND detail page\
  I want to see all CAR MODELs they have created\
  So I can get an overview over their range of cars

  @RULE_MCF-75
  Rule: The CAR MODEL section is not displayed when none are connected to the BRAND

    @TEST_MCF-95 @implemented
    Scenario: No CAR MODEL section when none are connected
      Given there exists a BRAND "Renault"
      And no CAR MODELs are connected to BRAND "Renault"
      When the user visits the detail page of the BRAND "Renault"
      Then there should be no section with a CAR MODEL list
