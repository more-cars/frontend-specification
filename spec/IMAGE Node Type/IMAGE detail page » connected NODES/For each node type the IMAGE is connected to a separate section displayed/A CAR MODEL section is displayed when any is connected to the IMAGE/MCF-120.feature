@REQ_MCF-49
Feature: IMAGE detail page » connected NODES
  As a contributor\
  On the IMAGE detail page\
  I want to see all connected NODEs\
  So I can find out where a connection might be missing

  @RULE_MCF-114
  Rule: For each node type the IMAGE is connected to a separate section displayed

    @TEST_MCF-120
    Scenario: A CAR MODEL section is displayed when any is connected to the IMAGE
      Given there exists an "IMAGE" "front bumper"
      And there exists a "CAR MODEL" "Seicento"
      And CAR MODEL "Seicento" is connected to IMAGE "front bumper"
      When the user visits the detail page of the "IMAGE" "front bumper"
      Then the page should contain a CAR MODEL section
      And the CAR MODEL section should contain the CAR MODEL "Seicento"
