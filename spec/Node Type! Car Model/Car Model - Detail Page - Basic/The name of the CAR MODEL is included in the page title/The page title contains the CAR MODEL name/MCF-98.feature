Feature: Car Model - Detail Page - Basic
  As a visitor\
  I want to have a dedicated page for each CAR MODEL\
  So every information about it can be found in one place

  @RULE_MCF-55
  Rule: The name of the CAR MODEL is included in the page title

    @TEST_MCF-98
    Scenario: The page title contains the CAR MODEL name
      Given there exists a CAR MODEL "Zonda"
      When the user visits the detail page of the CAR MODEL "Zonda"
      Then the page title should contain the term "Zonda"
