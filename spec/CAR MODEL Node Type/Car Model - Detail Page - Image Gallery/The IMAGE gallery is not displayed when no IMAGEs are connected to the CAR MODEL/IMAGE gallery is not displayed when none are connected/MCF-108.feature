@REQ_MCF-41
Feature: Car Model - Detail Page - Image Gallery
  As a visitor\
  On the CAR MODEL detail page\
  I want to see a gallery of all attached IMAGEs\
  So I can get a visual impression of the car from different angles

  @RULE_MCF-106
  Rule: The IMAGE gallery is not displayed when no IMAGEs are connected to the CAR MODEL

    @TEST_MCF-108
    Scenario: IMAGE gallery is not displayed when none are connected
      Given there exists a CAR MODEL "Camaro"
      And no IMAGEs are connected to CAR MODEL "Camaro"
      When the user visits the detail page of the CAR MODEL "Camaro"
      Then there should be no IMAGE gallery
