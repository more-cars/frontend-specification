It is significantly larger than the thumbnail images, but also much smaller than the screen size (in desktop view).\n* This lead image is provided by the API via the 'prime image' relationship.\n* When the CAR MODEL VARIANT has no 'prime image' then a generic fallback image is displayed instead.\n",
