@REQ_MCF-35
Feature: Brand - Detail Page - Basic
  As a visitor\
  I want to have a dedicated page for each BRAND\
  So every information about it can be found in one place

  @RULE_MCF-52
  Rule: The name of the BRAND is included in the page title

    @TEST_MCF-86
    Scenario: The page title contains the BRAND name
      Given there exists a BRAND "Audi"
      When the user visits the detail page of the BRAND "Audi"
      Then the page title should contain the term "Audi"
