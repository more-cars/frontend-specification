Feature: Image - Detail Page - Basic
  As a visitor\
  I want to have a dedicated page for each IMAGE\
  So every information about it can be found in one place

  @RULE_MCF-54
  Rule: A headline with the IMAGE name is displayed

    @TEST_MCF-109
    Scenario: The page headline contains the IMAGE name
      Given there exists an IMAGE "BMW logo"
      When the user visits the detail page of the IMAGE "BMW logo"
      Then the page headline should contain the term "BMW logo"
