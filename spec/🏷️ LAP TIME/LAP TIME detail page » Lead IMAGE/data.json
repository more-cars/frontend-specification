  "description": "* The detail page contains a section were the lead image of the LAP TIME is displayed.\n* The image is displayed in a prominent location on the page.\n* The image has a medium size. It is significantly larger than the thumbnail images, but also much smaller than the screen size (in desktop view).\n* This lead image is provided by the API via the 'prime image' relationship.\n* When the LAP TIME has no 'prime image' then a generic fallback image is displayed instead.\n",
