      Given there exists a BRAND "Renault"
      And there exists a CAR MODEL "Twingo"
      And CAR MODEL "Twingo" is connected to BRAND "Renault"
      When the user visits the detail page of the BRAND "Renault"
      Then there should be a section containing a CAR MODEL list
      And the CAR MODEL list should contain the CAR MODEL "Twingo"
