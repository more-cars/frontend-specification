  As a visitor\
  I want to have a dedicated page for each CAR MODEL\
  So every information about it can be found in one place

  Rule: A headline with the CAR MODEL name is displayed

    @TEST_MCF-97
    Scenario: The page headline contains the CAR MODEL name
      Given there exists a CAR MODEL "Zonda"
      When the user visits the detail page of the CAR MODEL "Zonda"
      Then the page headline should contain the term "Zonda"
