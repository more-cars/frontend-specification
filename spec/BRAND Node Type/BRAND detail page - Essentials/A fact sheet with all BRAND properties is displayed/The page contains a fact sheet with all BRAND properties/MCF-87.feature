    Scenario: The page contains a fact sheet with all BRAND properties
      Given there exists a BRAND "Audi"
      When the user visits the detail page of the BRAND "Audi"
      Then the page should contain a fact sheet
      And the fact sheet should display entries for each of the following properties
        | _property_ |
        | name       |
        | full_name  |
        | founded    |
